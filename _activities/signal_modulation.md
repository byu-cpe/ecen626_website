## Overview

To build off of the [Signal Discovery]({% link _activities/signal_discovery.md %}) and [Signal Recording]({% link _activities/signal_recording.md %}) activity, you will be *recording* a signal and *decoding* its modulation scheme. There are three signals at different frequencies that you will need to find, determine the modulation scheme, and demodulate by hand. The message will be an ASCII message that you will need to decode.

## Objectives

- Get experience demodulating different signals by hand.

- Get more practice with GNU Radio, Inspectrum, and related tools.

## Requirements

- You are welcome to do this activity however you see fit, however, I recommend you follow the same steps as the [Signal Recording]({% link _activities/signal_recording.md %}) activity.

- For each of the signals (there are three of them) answer the following questions:
  - What is the frequency of the signal?

  - What is the modulation scheme?

  - What is the message being sent in the signal?

- Upload your answers and flow graph to Learning Suite.
