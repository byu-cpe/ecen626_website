## Overview

To build off of the [Signal Discovery]({% link _activities/signal_discovery.md %}) activity, you will be *recording* a signal and *analyzing* its data. In the first half of this activity, I will provide a signal source for you to analyze. In the second half, you will find a different signal source and record it.

## Objectives

- Learn how to record a signal using GNU Radio.

- Learn how to use [Inspectrum](https://github.com/miek/inspectrum) to analyze the recorded signal.


## Requirements

- Build a flow graph to record a signal. You can use the flow graph from the [Signal Discovery]({% link _activities/signal_discovery.md %}) activity as a starting point.

- Think of ways of minimizing how much data you are collecting and narrowing the file to only the signal of interest.

- After recording the signal, view it on Inspectrum.

- Using Inspectrum's derived graphs, determine the modulation scheme, symbol rate, and data sent in the signal.

- Answer the following questions:
  - What is the frequency of the signal?

  - What is the modulation scheme?

  - What is the symbol rate?

  - What data is being sent in the signal?

- Find a different signal source and perform the same steps. The signal source can be your key fob for your car or any other signal you can find. You might have to do some investigation on how to determine the frequency of the device, such as going to [fccid.io](https://fccid.io/) and searching for your device.

- Upload your answers and flow graph to Learning Suite.
