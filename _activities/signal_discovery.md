## Overview

To become more familiar with SDRs and GNU Radio, you will search for a unique signal at an unknown frequency in this activity. I will be transmitting the signal from the front of the class.


## Objectives

- Learn how to use GNU Radio to find signals.

## Requirements

- Using an SDR, design a GNU Radio flowgraph to find a signal being transmitted from a nearby location. The only information I will give you is the broad range of frequencies it will be on: 902 MHz to 928 MHz.


- Answer the following questions:
  - What is the signal?
  - What is the frequency of the signal?

- Upload your answers and flow graph to Learning Suite.
